# DPI911SSA-Project
Project Report

Each group is assigned different techniques and tactics in MITRE attack framework. Use this excel sheet to see what techniques and tactics are assigned to you. 

Use Caldera or Atomic Red Team or an actual malware in a sandboxed enviornment to initiate the signal. You then identify a high fidelity indicator of compromise either using visibility tools, i.e. Facebook OS Query or Google's GRR, or Splunk filters to detect the incidents. 

You must report your progress on the job every session, starting Feb 21st, the status report must have at least the followings:

0- The estimated timeline of your project (you can report it for the first time and then after confirmation, we use this as a reference)

1-  What techniques/tactics are covered for that individual status report?

2- The percentage of coverage. 

3- Demonstrate the results
